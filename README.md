### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Orlando Umanzor and I am currently working through the [Odin Project](:theodinproject.com). I am excited to share my progress and projects with you.

###W hat I've Done So Far
I have completed the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and React sections of the Odin Project curriculum and am now working on the React section. 
Built several projects including:
[Shopping App](:github.com/OrlandoU/shopping-cart-project): A chance to practice my skills in React Routing.
[Resume Build](::github.com/OrlandoU/shopping-cart-project): A chance to practice my skills in React.

ðŸ”­ I am currently working on the React section of the Odin Project curriculum. I am looking forward to learning about building user interfaces with React and creating interactive web applications.

### My Goals
My ultimate goal is to become a full-stack web developer. I am excited to continue learning and improving my skills through the Odin Project and other resources. I hope to use my skills to build meaningful projects that make a positive impact on the world.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile. I look forward to connecting with you and sharing my journey as a budding web developer.
